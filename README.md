# Scientific-Computing# Python Basics

This repository contains scripts for understanding Python basics, control structures, and modular code.

## Objective of Each Script


### datatypes.py
- **Objective**: To demonstrate the use of various Python data types.
- **Description**: The script creates variables of different data types (int, float, complex, list, tuple, dict, set, bool), prints their types, and performs type conversions between int and float.



### control_structures.py
- **Objective**: To practice Python control structures.
- **Description**: The script checks if a user input number is even or odd, generates a list of even numbers from 1 to 50, prints numbers from 10 down to 1 using a while loop, and includes a function to classify numbers as even or odd.



### modular_functions.py
- **Objective**: To write modular Python code using functions.
- **Description**: The script defines a function to calculate the area of different shapes (circle, rectangle, triangle) and tests the function with multiple shapes.




## How to Run the Scripts

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd python_basics
   ```

2. **Run the scripts**:
   - **datatypes.py**:
     ```
     python datatypes.py
     ```
   - **control_structures.py**:
     ```
     python control_structures.py
     ```
   - **modular_functions.py**:
     ```
     python modular_functions.py
     ```
